The Rainbow & The Unicorn & The Ponies

The colours we feel,
The colours we crave,
The colours of a rainbow, 
The feelings we save.

The colours bring joy,
The colours bring hope,
The colours of a rainbow,
Allow us to cope.

The unicorn lives in the rainbow,
Absorbed by its colour and magic,
If the power of the rainbow vanished,
Then the unicorn's life would feel tragic.

The ponies all gallop to the rainbow,
They wish to bask in its glory,
The ponies dream of the unicorns, 
Together in their wondrous story.
