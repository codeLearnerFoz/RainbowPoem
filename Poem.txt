The Rainbow & The Unicorn

The colours we feel,
The colours we crave,
The colours of a rainbow, 
The feelings we save.

The colours bring joy,
The colours bring hope,
The colours of a rainbow,
Allow us to cope.

The unicorn lives in the rainbow,
Absorbed by its colour and magic,
If the power of the rainbow vanished,
Then the unicorn's life would feel tragic.
